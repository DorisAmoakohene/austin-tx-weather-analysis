# Austin Texas Project

## 🌦️ Climate Chronicles: Deep Dive into Austin, Texas Weather Patterns

This project explores weather data from Austin, Texas, spanning over three decades. Using a dataset recorded at 5-minute intervals, we transform raw meteorological data into daily summaries to uncover long-term trends and meaningful patterns.

## 🔍 What’s Inside
- Aggregation of high-frequency weather data using SQL and Python
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and trend visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Time-series insights on temperature, precipitation, and visibility
- Correlation and regression to identify key climate drivers
- A modular, well-documented Jupyter Notebook workflow

## 🧠 Who It’s For
Technical recruiters, data scientists, environmental analysts, and anyone curious about how local weather data reflects broader climate trends.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
SQL • Python • Pandas • Matplotlib • Seaborn • Jupyter Notebook
